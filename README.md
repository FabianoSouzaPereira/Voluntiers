For Church Volunteers Volunteering is at the heart of the church spirit and we understand the importance of a well-organized and efficient system for empowering our volunteers. The motivation behind this project is to create a centralized platform that simplifies communication, task management and collaboration between our volunteers.

## Architecture
  **Why Use Layers?** 
  <br />
Dividing an application into layers is a common practice in software architecture that provides several crucial benefits. Firstly, it enables the separation of responsibilities, where each layer has a clearly defined roleâ€”such as the presentation layer handling user interface, the domain layer managing business logic, and the data layer dealing with data access and storage. This separation enhances code readability and simplifies system maintenance.

Moreover, the modular nature of layer division allows for the creation of independent modules, facilitating the addition, removal, or replacement of functionalities without impacting other parts of the system. This modularity also promotes code reusability, as specific business logic in the domain layer can be easily employed in various sections of the application or even across different projects.

The ease of maintenance is another advantage, as issues within a particular layer can be isolated and addressed without affecting others, as long as the interfaces between the layers remain consistent. This segmentation enhances testability, enabling the conduct of isolated unit tests for each layer and ensuring the proper functioning of individual components.

Additionally, the architecture's scalability benefits from layer division, allowing different parts of the application to scale independently. For example, if there's an increased load on the database, the data layer can be scaled without directly impacting the presentation layer. The flexibility of technology is also a notable advantage, as each layer can be implemented using different technologies, provided the interfaces between them are respected. This flexibility allows for the adaptation to new technologies without the need for a complete redevelopment of the entire application. In summary, layer division promotes a well-organized, flexible, and easily maintainable architecture, contributing to the development of robust and sustainable applications in the long run.

## Data
The data layer is responsible for data access and interaction with external data sources, such as APIs, databases, or caches. Here, you'll find elements related to data access and manipulation.

- **DataSources:** Classes responsible for interacting directly with external data sources. For example, a LoginDataSource that makes calls to an authentication service.

- **Repositories:** Interfaces and implementations that define how data is fetched and manipulated. They act as an abstraction layer between the DataSources and UseCases.

- **Data Models:** Classes that represent the structure of data in the application.
<br />

## Domain 
In the domain layer, you typically place domain entities, business rules, and application logic that are not directly related to data manipulation or the user interface. Here are some common elements that can be found in the domain layer:

- **Domain Entities:** Classes representing important business concepts. For example, if your application is a task management system, you may have a Task entity containing information about a task, such as title, description, creation date, etc.

- **Business Rules:** Logic that implements the rules and policies of the domain. For instance, specific validations for your domain that do not belong to the presentation or data layer.

- **Use Cases:** Classes that encapsulate a specific task or complete functionality of your application. They orchestrate the execution of operations on entities and repositories to perform specific actions.

- **Interfaces:** Contracts defining interactions between the domain layer and other layers, such as interfaces for repositories or external services.

- **Events or Observers:** Mechanisms for communication between components of the domain layer. This may include implementing patterns like Observer or using events to notify interested parties about changes in the state.

- **Domain Exceptions:** Domain-specific exception classes that capture errors or exceptional conditions occurring during the execution of business rules.
<br />

## Presentation 
The presentation layer is responsible for the user interface and data presentation. Here, you'll find elements related to the UI, such as activities, fragments, adapters, ViewModels, and other components that handle presentation logic. Additionally, you may have sub-packages for each resource or functionality of the application.

- **ViewModels:** Classes containing presentation logic and responsible for managing and providing data to user interfaces.

- **Adapters:** If you are using lists or grids, adapters can be used to associate data with UI elements.
- **Reusable UI Components:** Any UI component that is shared among various parts of the application.
<br />
<br />

## Here's a quick explanation of the layers and their responsibilities:
This architecture follows principles of Clean Architecture and/or Hexagonal Architecture, promoting a clear separation of responsibilities among different layers of your application.



- **UI (User Interface):** The user interface layer contains classes that directly handle user presentation and interaction. Typically, this includes activities, fragments, and UI components, as well as the ViewModel to manage UI logic.

- **ViewModel:** The ViewModel acts as an intermediary layer between the UI and use cases. It's responsible for managing the UI state and providing necessary data to the user interface. The ViewModel interacts with use cases to obtain data and perform actions.

- **UseCases:** Use cases encapsulate the specific business logic of your application. They orchestrate the operations required to meet the requirements of a specific functionality. Use cases interact with domain entities.

- **Entities:** Entities represent the main domain objects of your application. They are usually simple data objects containing minimal business logic if any.

- **Repository:** Repositories define interfaces for accessing data. They provide an abstraction layer between use cases and data sources (DataSource). Concrete repository implementations are responsible for coordinating specific data retrieval and storage operations.

- **DataSource (Web or Local):** DataSources are responsible for interacting directly with data sources, such as a web API or a local database. They provide a concrete implementation for basic data read and write operations.

This type of architecture promotes modularity, making it easier to replace or change components without affecting other parts of the system. Additionally, it helps keep business logic independent of implementation details and facilitates unit testing for each layer separately.


# Retrofit with Coroutine
Although the Retrofit API call is happening within a try-catch block, I considered using withContext to ensure that the execution occurs in the appropriate context.

### In ViewModel

   ```kotlin
        loginButton.setOnClickListener {
            loadingProgressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
            lifecycleScope.launch {
                viewModel.login(
                    usernameEditText.text.toString(),
                    passwordEditText.text.toString()
                )
            }
        }
```


### In DataModule 

```kotlin
        @Provides
        @Singleton
        fun provideAuthApiService(): IAuthApiService {
            return Retrofit.Builder()
                .baseUrl("https://example.com/api/")
                .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
                .build()
                .create(IAuthApiService::class.java)
        }
 ```
